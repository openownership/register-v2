        %h2 What is beneficial ownership?
        %p A beneficial owner is a person who ultimately has the right to some share of a corporate vehicleâ€™s income or assets, or the ability to control its activities. Beneficial ownership transparency reveals how companies and other legal entities or arrangements, such as trusts, are owned and controlled by their beneficial owners.
        %p <strong>Journalists</strong> can use beneficial ownership information to follow the money.
        %p <strong>Businesses can</strong> use beneficial ownership information to reduce risk and know who they are doing business with.
        %p <strong>Investigators</strong> can use beneficial ownership to recover proceeds of crime.
