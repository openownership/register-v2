Beneficial ownership data in Slovakia's Commercial Register is not yet available for public
search.

Open Ownership [ingests, maps and transforms the RPVS data](https://bods-data.openownership.org/source/slovakia) in line with [version 0.2 of our Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/) before making it available for anyone to reuse in a range of formats.

We also reconcile and enrich this using bulk data from OpenCorporates. These mappings are currently a work in progress and should be treated with caution. The dataset is published under the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).
