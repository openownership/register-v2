The CVR Register data is publicly and freely available in two formats:

- [Searchable online](https://datacvr.virk.dk/) by company name, number,
  address, person name, etc
- [API access](https://datacvr.virk.dk/artikel/system-til-system-adgang-til-cvr-data)
  via ElasticSearch

The Danish Business Authority withholds API data relating to ‘entities protected
against unsolicited advertising’. This data is only available to API users if
they formally commit to respect those same protections
([Clause 7](https://datacvr.virk.dk/artikel/vilkaar-og-betingelser)).

The CVR Register data is
[licensed by statute](https://datafordeler.dk/vejledning/hent-data/).

Open Ownership [ingests, maps and transforms the CVR data](https://bods-data.openownership.org/source/denmark) in line with [version 0.2 of our Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/) before making it available for anyone to reuse in a range of formats.

We also reconcile and enrich this using bulk data from OpenCorporates. These mappings are currently a work in progress and should be treated with caution. The dataset is published under the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).
