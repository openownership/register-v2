  (searchable by names of individuals or companies)
- Downloadable via a [daily JSON snapshot](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_pscdata.html).
- Available via Application Programming Interface (API) through the [Companies House Public Data API](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/companies-house-public-data-api/reference/persons-with-significant-control) or [Streaming API](https://developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk/streaming-api/reference/persons-with-significant-control).

Open Ownership [ingests, maps and transforms this data](https://bods-data.openownership.org/source/UK_PSC/) in line with [version 0.2 of our Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/) before making it available for anyone to reuse in a range of formats.

We also reconcile and enrich this using bulk data from OpenCorporates. These mappings are currently a work in progress and should be treated with caution. The dataset is published under the [Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).
